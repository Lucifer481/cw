            <h2>Introduction to Python</h2>
            <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax
                allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. Python is a great language for beginners and experienced programmers
                alike, and it's a great language for teaching and learning programming. It has many built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets etc., which makes writing complex programs easy.

            <h3>Python Language</h3>
            <p> print(“hello world”) <br> test.py or py test.py (to run code) Compared to other language it is easiest language. Library support, easiness and concise code python is popular. The official name of python is "Monty Python", named after Monty
                Python's Flying Circus sketch comedy series created by Guido van Rossum (also known as BD FLY).
                <|im_sep|>
                    In simple terms, Python is an interpreted high level general purpose programming language that can be used on various platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Raspberry Pi, Microcontrollers or web applications development using frameworks
                    such as Django, Flask, iOS, Raspberry Pi, etc..
